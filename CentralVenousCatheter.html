            <h1>Central Venous Catheter</h1>
            <p>
              A central venous catheter (CVC) is a type of access used for hemodialysis. Tunneled CVCs are placed under the skin and into a large central vein, preferably the internal jugular veins.  CVCs are meant to be used for a short period of time until a more permanent type of dialysis access has been established.</p>

<p>Tunneled CVCâ€™s are placed under the skin and meant to be used for a longer duration of time versus non-tunneled, which are designed to be temporary.</p>

<p>What is the Procedure for Central Venous Catheter Placement?
This procedure is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. The central venous catheter placement procedure begins with your physician administering local anesthesia to numb the selected area for catheter insertion.  Ultrasound may be used to determine the exact site on the body where the catheter will be placed.  Fluoroscopy, a type of x-ray, may be used to further guide the catheter through the skin, and into the selected central vein. The catheter is advanced into the central vein until the tip of the CVC reaches the right atrium. There are small cuffs on the catheter that lay just under the skin that aid in keeping the catheter properly placed and minimize the risk of infection.</p>
