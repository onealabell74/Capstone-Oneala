            <h1>Center</h1>
            <p>Center hemodialysis is when a person goes to a dialysis center for their hemodialysis treatments. Hemodialysis is a treatment that filters the blood of wastes and extra fluid when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function.</p>

              <h1>Home</h1>
              <p>Home hemodialysis (HHD) is the modality of hemodialysis done in the home. During home hemodialysis, blood flows from the patient's vascular access through a dialysis machine. The dialysis machine cleanses the blood of extra waste and fluids and sends the clean blood back into the body. Patients on home hemodialysis have the option of performing more frequent or longer dialysis treatments, which may contribute to better clinical outcomes and an overall improved quality of life.</p>
