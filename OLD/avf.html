            <h1>Arteriovenous Fistula</h1>
            <p>An AV fistula is a surgical connection made between an artery and a vein, created by a vascular specialist. An AV fistula is typically located in your arm, however, if necessary it can be placed in the leg.  With an AV fistula, blood flows from the artery directly into the vein, increasing the blood pressure and amount of blood flow through the vein.   The increased flow and pressure causes the veins to enlarge. The enlarged veins will be capable of delivering the amount of blood flow necessary to provide an adequate hemodialysis treatment. AV fistulas are the preferred vascular access for long-term dialysis because they last longer than any other dialysis access types, are less prone to infection and clotting, and can be relied upon for predictable performance.

              Advantages of an AV fistula
              Remains functional longer than other forms of vascular access
              No synthetic material implanted in your body
              Provides the necessary blood flow needed for effective dialysis, which may help to decrease treatment time
              Low risk of infection
              Less prone to clotting than other dialysis access options
              Created in an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia
              Fast return to your daily activities
