            <h1>Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter</h1>
            <p>
              Before you can begin peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatments, you need to have a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placed as an access for the removal of waste and toxins from your body.  A PD catheter, the only type of dialysis access used for PD, is placed through your abdomen and into the peritoneal space through the peritoneal membrane—the thin membrane that lines your abdominal wall.
