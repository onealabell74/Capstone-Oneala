    <h1>The Web page is about taking control of your Treatment</h1>
    <p>Dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that rids your body of unwanted toxins, waste products and excess fluids by filtering your blood. When kidneys fail, your body may have difficulty cleaning your blood and keeping your system chemically balanced. Dialysis can take the place of some kidney function and, along with medication and proper care, help people live longer.
    </p>
    <p>There are many different types of dialysis treatments. You have to decide what is best for you. Take in factors such as your lifestyle. Because dialysis is like having a part time job. Think of at such. I hope this will help you decide what is best for you. Cause this is not a one size fits all.
