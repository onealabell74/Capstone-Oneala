<h1>Arteriovenous Graft</h1>
<p>
  An arteriovenous (AV) graft is a type of access used for hemodialysis. The graft is usually placed in the arm, but may be placed in the leg if necessary.  An AV graft is the connection of a vein and an artery that utilizes a hollow, synthetic tube (the actual “graft”).  One end of the tube is connected to an artery and the other end of the tube is connected to a vein.  This connection results in blood flowing from the high flow, high pressure artery through the graft and into the low flow, low pressure vein.  As a result the blood flow through the graft provides a flow rate that will deliver enough blood to provide an adequate hemodialysis treatment.

  What is the procedure for placing an AV graft?
  Local anesthesia is administered to the area selected for graft placement. The physician makes two small incisions in order to access the artery and vein. Next, one end of the graft is surgically connected to the artery, the other end is connected to the vein. Once placed, blood now flows from the artery, through the graft and into the vein. This allows needles to be placed into the graft for hemodialysis.

  Advantages of an AV graft:

  An AV graft provides a solution for small or weak veins.
  An AV graft can be used as soon as two to four weeks after placement.
  AV graft surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis, under local anesthetic, allowing for a rapid and easy recovery.
