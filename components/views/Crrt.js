            <h1>Continous Renal Replacement</h1>
            <p>
              Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is a slow and continuous extracorporeal blood purification therapy. CRRT mimics the functions of the kidneys in regulating water, electrolytes, and toxic products by the continuous slow removal of solutes and fluid. CRRT is indicated in patients who meet criteria for hemodialysis therapy but cannot tolerate conventional intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) due to hemodynamic instability.
